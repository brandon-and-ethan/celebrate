### Lodging

We are aware of how expensive destination weddings can be, and we've made signifcant efforts to keep the weekend as inexpensive as possible.
While many guests may choose to use services such as AirBnB, we have reserved several rooms at the Riverwalk in the event of low supply or quality.

```
Riverwalk Place Resort
777 West Cedar Avenue
Gladwin, Michigan 48624
```

The total cost per person at Riverwalk Place for three nights is approximately $400. This includes a spa package, but does not include gratuities.
If you would like to book Riverwalk Place, please call the lodging manager at 989-246-8000. Rooms are reserved under the name Mazey.
We also have reserved rooms at a sister hotel, the Rivertown Inn.

```
Rivertown Inn
1220 East Cedar Avenue
Gladwin, Michigan 48624
```

This option does not include spa services, all rooms are double-occupancy, and is significantly less expensive.
If you would like to book the Rivertown Inn, please call the lodging manager at 989-246-9130 and use the name Mazey.

We encourage our guests to remain skeptical of AirBnB offerings in this remote area.

### Transportation

We suggest you plan to arrive in Michigan on Thursday, July 2nd and depart on Sunday, July 5th.

Flights to DTW (Detroit), TVC (Traverse City), or MBS (Bay City) are generally inexpensive. LGA to DTW is $150 round trip with Spirit Airlines!
For the best experience we recommend traveling Delta to MBS or DTW. TVC is also an option if you wish to extend your stay.

***Services such as Uber and Lyft are unreliable in this area! You will need to rent a car to get around over the weekend!***

As described in the event calendar, we will have transportation organized to and from the Riverwalk for the wedding day;
however, you will at the very least need to get from the airport to the lodging of your choice.
We will help organize carpools if needed using my contact information found in the last section!

* Detroit (DTW) + car rental = 3 hour drive maximum
* Traverse City (TVC) + car rental = 2 hour drive maximum
* Bay City (MBS) + car rental = 1 hour drive maximum (best option)

### Clothing & Attire

Being that all events on the 3rd and 4th will take place outside, we recommend our guests dress comfortably & casually.
You will need ***at least one long-sleeved shirt and full-length pants*** for the ceremony on the 3rd.
Do not wear heels!

Repellent and sun screen will be provided, but we encourage you to pack products of your choice as well.
We encourage you to ***pack swimwear and pair of shorts*** for the celebration on the 4th!
It gets chilly at night, you may want to bring a long-sleeved shirt or sweater for the firework events.

If you are interested in wearing ceremonial colors we have decided to use khaki, white, and sage.
