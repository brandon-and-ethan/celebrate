Being that all events on the 3rd and 4th will take place outside, we encourage our guests to dress comfortably & casually.
You will need at least one long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans (or other full-length pants) for the ceremony on the 3rd.
This is due to the insects on Farwell which will FEAST ON YOUR SUPPLE FLESH given the opportunity.
Repellent and sun screen will be provided, but we encourage you to pack products of your choice as well.
Do not forget to pack a swim suit for the celebration on the 4th as well!
