### Lodging, Transportation, & Expenses

We are aware of how expensive destination weddings can be, and we've made a signifcant effort to keep the weekend as inexpensive as possible for our guests.
While many guests may choose to use services such as AirBnB, we have reserved several rooms at Riverwalk Place in the event of low supply or quality.

```
Riverwalk Place
777 West Cedar Avenue
Gladwin, Michigan 48624
```

The total cost per person for two days is $306.34 after tax. This includes some spa services, but does not include gratuities.
If you would like to book the Riverwalk, please call the lodging manager at 989-246-9130 and mention your status as a wedding guest!
We encourage our guests to remain somewhat skeptical of AirBnB offerings in the area.

Flights to DTW (Detroit), TVC (Traverse City), or MBS (Bay City) are generally inexpensive. LGA to DTW is $150.00 round trip with Spirit Airlines!
For the best experience we recommend traveling Delta to MBS or DTW, though TVC is also relatively close.

***Services such as Uber and Lyft are unreliable in this area! You will most likely need to rent a car to get around over the weekend!***
As described in the event calendar below, we will have transportation organized to and from the Riverwalk for certain events;
however, you will at the very least need to get from the airport to the lodging of your choice.
We will help organize carpools if needed using my contact information found in the last section!

TODO - encourage people to come on the 2nd and stay until the 5th?

### Clothing & Attire

Being that all events on the 3rd and 4th will take place outside, we encourage our guests to dress comfortably & casually.
You will need ***at least one long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans*** (or other full-length pants) for the ceremony on the 3rd.
This is due to insects on Farwell which will FEAST ON YOUR SUPPLE FLESH given the opportunity!

Repellent and sun screen will be provided, but we encourage you to pack products of your choice as well.
Do not forget to ***pack a swim suit*** for the celebration on the 4th as well!

### Gifts & Registry

Your presence is a gift; we do not have a wedding registry.

If you insist on giving us a gift, we encourage you to donate to one of the following charitable organizations which we
have picked to represent our passions and interests:

TODO - add links!
