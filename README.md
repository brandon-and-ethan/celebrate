### Lodging

We are aware of how expensive destination weddings can be, and we've made a signifcant effort to keep the weekend as inexpensive as possible for our guests.
While many guests may choose to use services such as AirBnB, we have reserved several rooms at the Riverwalk in the event of low supply or quality.

```
Riverwalk Place Resort
777 West Cedar Avenue
Gladwin, Michigan 48624
```

The total cost per person at Riverwalk Place for two days is $306.34 after tax. This includes a spa package, but does not include gratuities.
You may also choose to arrive earlier on July 2nd.
If you would like to book Riverwalk Place, please call the lodging manager at 989-246-8000 and use the name Mazey.
We also have reserved rooms at a sister hotel, the Rivertown Inn.

```
Rivertown Inn
1220 East Cedar Avenue
Gladwin, Michigan 48624
```

This option does not include any spa services and is therefore somewhat less expensive.
If you would like to book the Rivertown Inn, please call the lodging manager at 989-246-9130 and use the name Mazey.

The Doherty Hotel in Clare, Michigan is another lodging option, but you should know that the grounds are haunted.
Clare is a charming town with wonderful people; however, the local hotel is a bubbling crockpot of hateful spirits.
We encourage our guests to remain somewhat skeptical of AirBnB offerings in the area.

### Transportation

We suggest you plan to arrive in Michigan on Thursday, July 2nd and depart on Sunday, July 5th.

Flights to DTW (Detroit), TVC (Traverse City), or MBS (Bay City) are generally inexpensive. LGA to DTW is $150.00 round trip with Spirit Airlines!
For the best experience we recommend traveling Delta to MBS or DTW, though TVC is also relatively close.

***Services such as Uber and Lyft are unreliable in this area! You will most likely need to rent a car to get around over the weekend!***
As described in the event calendar below, we will have transportation organized to and from the Riverwalk for certain events;
however, you will at the very least need to get from the airport to the lodging of your choice.
We will help organize carpools if needed using my contact information found in the last section!

* Detroit (DTW) + car rental = 3 hour drive maximum
* Taverse City (TVC) + car rental = 2 hour drive maximum
* Bay City (MBS) + car rental = 1 hour drive maximum

### Clothing & Attire

Being that all events on the 3rd and 4th will take place outside, we encourage our guests to dress comfortably & casually.
You will need ***at least one long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans*** (or other full-length pants) for the ceremony on the 3rd.
This is due to insects on Farwell which will feast on your supple flesh given the opportunity.

Repellent and sun screen will be provided, but we encourage you to pack products of your choice as well.
Do not forget to ***pack a swim suit*** for the celebration on the 4th as well!

If you are interested in wearing ceremonial colors we have decided to use khaki, white, and sage.

NO HEELS!

### Gifts & Registry

Your presence is a gift; we do not have a wedding registry.

### Contact Information

Feel free to email me at <b.mazey@nyu.edu> with any questions or concerns!
As travel reservations materialize, I will be helping our guests organize ground transport.
Please send me an email if you are interested in carpooling or booking an AirBnB with friends. :)
